            A <b> zombie </b> (Haitian French: <i> zombi </i>, Haitian Creole: <i> zonbi </i>) is an undead being created
            through the reanimation of a human corpse. The term comes from Haitian folklore, where a zombie is a dead body
            reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do
            not necessarily involve magic but often invoked by methods such as carriers, radiation, mental diseases, vectors,
            pathogens, scientific accidents, etc.
